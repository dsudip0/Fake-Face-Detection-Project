# Fake Face Detection Project
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

### 1. Installation

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

    .\venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

    source venv/bin/activate

2. Install required libraries:


    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python numpy dlib imutils scikit-learn
3. Real Face Dataset:

    Collect a dataset of real faces for training. You can use a dataset like Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) or create your own.

4. Fake Face Dataset:
   
    Collect a dataset of fake faces (spoofed faces). This can include images of printed photos, digital screens, or other methods that can be used to fool facial recognition.
    
5. Image Preprocessing:
   
    Resize and normalize the images to prepare them for training.

6. Model Training:
   
   Train a machine learning model using a library like Dlib or OpenCV. You can use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for better accuracy.

7. Model Evaluation:

    Evaluate the model on a separate set of real and fake face images to assess its accuracy.

8. Integration with Webcam:

    Use the trained model to process live video feed from a webcam and detect whether the face is real or fake.

9. Implement Alert System:

    If a fake face is detected, implement an alert system, such as a message or sound notification.
